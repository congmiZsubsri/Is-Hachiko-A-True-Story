# Is Hachiko A True Story
  
Hidesaburō Ueno, a professor in agriculture science at The University of Tokyo in Japan, had long wanted a purebred Japanese Akita dog. He had looked for the perfect Akita puppy for a long time until one of his students encouraged him to adopt a puppy he had found in Odate City, in the northern part of Japan.

As Hachi grew older, he started to see his owner off to work in the morning at the Shibuya Train Station in central Tokyo and went to pick him up at the station in the afternoon when he returned from work.
 
It turned out that Professor Ueno had suffered from a cerebral hemorrhage and died suddenly and unexpectedly while at work 53 years old. Hachi had been with Professor Ueno for one year and four months by then.
 
Hachi moved in with a former gardener of the Ueno Family, Kozaburo Kobayashi. But throughout the rest of his ten-year-long life, he kept going to the Shibuya Train Station every afternoon precisely when the train was due to enter the station. He sat there for hours, patiently waiting in vain for the return of his beloved owner, who sadly never came back.
 
The story of the dog that never gave up also gained a lot of attention in national media, inspiring many people from all over the world to visit Hachiko at Shibuya Train Station to offer him treats. He touched the hearts of the Japanese people and soon became their hero.
 
This is my favorite Hachiko statue and shows a hearty reunion between Hachiko and Hidesaburō. It is placed under a huge tree and feels so peaceful. There is a bench next to the statue, which is the perfect place to sit down for a bit and do some philosophical thinking about loyalty, love, and devotion. There were also no other people there when we visited this statue, so we did not have to rush it, as is often the case at the Hachiko statue at Shibuya Station, where there is always a queue of people wanting to take a photo.

Tokyo is a great city to visit, especially if you are a Hachiko fan. Make sure to visit the Hachiko Statue at Shibuya Train Station, the monument of Hachiko next to his owner`s tomb in Aoyama cemetery, and last but not least visit Hachiko himself which is on display at the National Science Museum in Ueno.
 
**Hotel MyStays Asakusabashi**We stayed at Hotel MyStays in Asakusabashi and really liked this hotel! It is brand new, and the rooms are actually decent sized compared to the average hotel in Japan (choose a twin room if you need the biggest room). The neighborhood is great, with lots of restaurants and cafes, and a short walk to the underground station Asakusabashi. It was the cheapest and best hotel we could find in Tokyo.

Missouri has two dogs that are most famous. The first dog is Jim the Wonder dog, and the second is about a trial in the 19the century. That trial is called The Old Drum Trial. Read the summation the lawyer gave to the dog. Jim the Wonder Dog is the most amazing story you quite likely will ever read. The dog was truly uncanny.
 
I really cried while reading this wonderful story. Im so glad that the people in Japan felt the same, and thought of him plus making these wonderful decorations at the station, and also rebuilding it. Proud of them, seriously.
 
The movie is great and so emotional! I still cry every time I see it. ? The movie is, however, not a documentary so Hollywood have probably made some small changes to the story and not pictured the persons exactly right. I agree, Hachi is the perfect example of the pure heart and love that dogs have towards humans and their owners.
 
Wow, I also have a birthday this month and will be 64. I never knew about this movie or the story. I got up early this morning about 5am, and only caught the last half hour after the master had already died, and was intrequed and saddened by it. I want to see it from the beginning so I check our TV listing and see that it will be showing again on next Sunday evening the 4/15. Lord willing I will be watching it. We lost our dog Rambo a couple of years ago, he died 10 years to the day he was born in. I am a huge animal lover, especially dogs.
 
I so agree with your ,the wife was a totally cow in the memory of her she should at least found a loving home for the dog if she could not love it herself, also the people that that left the dog like are a disgrace. I am sure if someone had shown the dog love started taken it for walks and spending time together that dog would have bonded with anyone.  
If any of these people are still live they should be ashamed of them selves  
This film was very upsetting to me
 
This movie was so sweet and so sad.I got so choked up and cry baby that I actually had to take a XANAX to calm down and I am still teared up.  
UNIVERSALLY we should all have this kind of love for each other.
 
Wow that dog (Hachiko) was the mostly sweetest dog I ever saw. He was  
the best friend to the owner. He was so beautiful dog and very spirit , he made my life so inspiring. He was very very smart pet, so faithfully dog.  
I cried when it happened about him waiting for his owner for almost 10  
years. He now is in rainbow bridge now with God. amen. One day we all  
will meet him up there in heaven with my sweet wolfina (husky/golden retriever), she was so beautiful pet, we were so happy have her in our lives. I miss my wolfina so much she was15 years old now in rainbow bridge with all the animals with God. I love all the animals that God created.
 
I just saw the movie with Richard Gere.the US version of Hatchi and I am 61. I cried so much at the end of the movie. I wondered who took care of him and where he was buried. Does anyone know. I have 2 dogs and love them to death and spoil them rotten.
 
Yeah I cried so much watching both the Japanese and the American film. Every year on April 8 there is a memorial ceremony for Hachiko in Shibuya, by the statue. I have been there twice and its a beautiful ceremony with lots of flowers and speeches. This year 2015 its going to be the 80th annual ceremony. Its 80 years ago since Hachiko died. Beautiful story of an amazing dog.
 
Wow, congrats on finishing your first book! That is awesome! I am planning to write a book too. It seems like a lot of work though so have to find some time to fully focus on it. It is so cool that you have started blogging! Everyone can blog, no matter what age. Good luck with all your projects!
 
Although it seemed that Hachiko waited in vain for his owner, it was explained to me that this was not the case. The dog knew that his owner had passed and going to the train station was the closest thing he could do to be close to his owner and to remember his owner.
 
It`s a bit difficult to know what Hachiko or any dog is thinking, but yes it might be that he went to the train station to remember his beloved owner. We used to have two Siberian Husky dogs, called Varga and Tiksi. When the old one Tiksi died, Varga kept looking for her best friend for a long time. I felt so sorry for her.
 
I was surprised too that Hachiko only had two years with his owner, and that he waited at the train station in Tokyo for his owner to return for eight years! But I read somewhere that one year for us humans is like seven years for a dog, so then he got around fourteen years with his owner. I have had fifteen years with my dog from she was 5 weeks old and up until now being 15, and even that feels like too little! ? Hope she will be around for a few more years, she is still of very good health hiking with me in the mountains almost every day.
 
I was told to watch this film after sending my puppy to training, one of the owners said my cross puppy german shepherd had a bit of Akita in her and to watch the film. Wow, I thought it was amazing, very sad and I cried a lot. But Sky my puppy who is 7 months now is so intelligent and loving and come second in a competition against all the other pedigree puppies as she is so clever!! Love all animals and loved this thread!!
 
Awww, your Akita dog seems to have been really sweet and loyalty! You must miss her. I have never owned an Akita dog, but they seem to be very devoted and attached to their owners. 13 year is a lot for a big dog like the Akita, you must have given him a good life then. My Siberian husky dog is 16, she still goes skiing with me. I love her so much.
 
I agree, the story about Hachiko is such an amazing story, and that it`s true makes it, even more, sweet and heartbreaking. Your family dog seems to have been the perfect dog and best friend. I have good memories too of the dogs that have been a part of my life over the years. I was born into a dog-loving-family and have had dogs all my life. Can`t imagine a life without a dog.
 
Our dog Varga died last week, at 16 years of age, and it was just heartbreaking. I miss her a lot! It is the first time in my life without having a dog, and I can tell you, life is not as fun without a dog. ?
 
Wow, so cool that you are studying and learning about amazing animals! Hachiko is one of the most amazing animals I have ever heard of. I got really touched by the story about Hachiko and his dedication once I heard it while visiting Tokyo.
 
Really a cried a lot. This movie reminds me my pet pinky who is no more. It makes me feel like dogs are the most faithful towards their loved ones. He is been a best companion for the professor. I wanna make pet like this. ? . Thanks for the article though. It explains the true story of hachi !!!
 
A great story about a loyal, fathful dog. I watched the movie with Richard Gere and loved it and yes I cried but it reminded me of my Star. Star a black lab, born in 2005 and came to live with me in 2009. Belonged to my neighbor but always wanted to be with me. Given to me in May 2009. Past away in 2013 from cancer and I still talk to her every day. I still put flowers on her grave at least once a month.
